<summary>Correct Answer</summary>

```Python
time_until_midnight = "5"
print("There are " + time_until_Midnight + " hours until midnight")
```

There is a typo in the last line, it should be time_until_midnight not time_until_Midnight. Because when the name of the variable was used it was not spelt the same, you will get a name error.
