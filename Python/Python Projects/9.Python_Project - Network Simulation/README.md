# Implementation of Network Layer Functionalities

## Objective

The simulator should be at least capable of Creating and configuring a router assigning well-formatted classless IPV4 address to the devices

- Using ARP to find the MAC address of a host within a network
- Performing static routing
- Implementing RIP or OSPF protocols for dynamic routing
- Implement Transport and Application layer functionalities

The simulator is capable of assigning port no.’s to various processes, both well-known and ephemeral port no.’s and enables process-process communication

- Performing address learning in case of a switch
- Implement at least one sliding window flow control protocol at the transport layer (Go Back N or Selective repeat). You can also reuse it from Layer 2 functionality (Submission 1) for the transport layer data unit (TCP datagram or UDP segment)
-Implement at least two application layer services

## Languages And Libraries

- Language: Python 3
- Libraries: Matplotlib, Time, Random, Sqlite3 Networkx, Netaddr, Threading

## Prerequisite

- Basic knowledge of Python language and Logic of different network layers
