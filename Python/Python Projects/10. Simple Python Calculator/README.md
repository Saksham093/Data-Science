# Simple Python Calculator

This is a simple Python calculator that can perform basic arithmetic operations such as `addition`, `subtraction`, `multiplication`, and `division`. Users can interact with the calculator through the command line.

## How to Use

1. Run the Python script in your preferred Python environment.
2. You will be presented with a menu of options:

   - Enter 'add' for addition
   - Enter 'subtract' for subtraction
   - Enter 'multiply' for multiplication
   - Enter 'divide' for division
   - Enter 'quit' to end the program

3. Type one of the available options (e.g., 'add') and press Enter.
4. If you chose an arithmetic operation, you will be prompted to enter two numbers, one at a time.
5. The program will display the result of the selected operation.
6. You can continue performing calculations by following steps 2-5, or you can enter 'quit' to exit the program.

Please note that the calculator does not handle advanced operations or error checking beyond division by zero. Ensure that you provide valid input to avoid unexpected behavior.

## Example
